Even before Kenya attained its independence in December 1963, Matiba had already joined the high echelons of the Kenya's civil service becoming the first indigenous African Permanent Secretary for Education in May 1963. Matiba was the fair-eyed boy of Carey Francis the Head Master of Alliance High School who lobbied for his promotion to the Permanent Secretary's position. In 1964 he was appointed the Permanent Secretaryfor Commerce under the minister Mwai Kibaki. Matiba's star continued to shine in the post-colonial period helped by his connections with the prominent Kiambu family of Musa Gitau who was one of the first Africans to become the Minister of the Presbyterian Church in Kenya. Matiba's wife Edith is Musa Gitau's daughter. Musa Gitau had a hand in molding the early life of Jomo Kenyatta having taught him at the PCEA Center at Thogoto, Kikuyu. In the patron-client reward system that Kenyatta established after independence such connections were vital for one to succeed in public career or in business. Matiba was to later abandon his civil service career to venture into Hotel hospitality industry. He established the Alliance Group of Hostels setting his base at South Coast. He also invested in high cost private schools, including Hillcrest Preparatory (founded by Frank Thompson) and Hillcrest Secondary School. Kenneth Matiba was the chairman of Kenya Football Federation from 1974 to 1978.

He served as a Minister of Transport and Communications, under the KANU administration led by then president Daniel arap Moi, but Matiba resigned from his post in December 1988. At Moi's instructions Matiba was detained at the Kamiti Maximum Security Prison in 1990 without trial. He was imprisoned together with Charles Rubia, another leading figure calling for multiparty democracy. Whilst there Matiba was refused medication and suffered a massive stroke, which affected half of his body and incapacitated him for some time. Later, a multiparty system was inaugurated and Matiba was released. He was part of the opposition alliance that formed the popular movement by the name Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD). During the December 1992 election, he was the candidate of FORD-Asili, a party that he had helped found by splintering from the original FORD. President Moi won the elections on KANU's ticket, while Matiba placed second. Matiba won Kiharu Constituency parliamentary seat at the parliamentary elections held concurrently. Matiba boycotted the December 1997 election, citing lack of democracy, and even burned his voter's card. Matiba has a long-standing rivalry with the current Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki. Before the December 2002 election, Matiba was leader of the small Saba Saba Asili party, which declined to join the NARC coalition. Matiba did not run for the presidency or for a parliamentary seat. More recently, Matiba has been dogged by ill-health which stemmed from his imprisonment years before. Additionally, his business empire has suffered with first his hotel chain briefly being taken into administration, although he has since regained control, and then his Hillcrest Schools being sold by administrators, a case which he took to court. He has since regained control of the school which he later sold to a consortium led by Fanisi. Matiba is also founder of The People newspaper. It started as a weekly in 1992, but turned to daily in 1998. The paper is one problem contributing to Matiba's troubled finances. As of 2008, he is still the chairman of Saba Saba Asili. In addition, he has re-registered as a voter. In November 2007, he announced that he would be a presidential candidate in the December 2007 election. He placed seventh with 8,046 votes.

683	Having been published by an alleged friend the book is often assumed to be an authoritative account of Wilson's life. In actuality, the book contains numerous errors in chronology and geography and is often dramatically at odds with the historical record and with most other accounts of the Wilsons' story. For instance, it reports that William was born in 1774 and his sister in 1776, meaning that Elizabeth would have been approximately nine years old when she was hanged, and William eleven. It tells that she gave birth to a single child whom she killed immediately after birth; in this version, her jailhouse confession was simply an acknowledgment of her guilt and sinful nature. It also reports that William was born in the city of Lebanon, in Dauphin County. Lebanon City was indeed a part of Dauphin County from 1785 through 1813; however, when William was born it was still a part of Lancaster County, and by the time of his death and Hermits publication that territory had long been a part of Lebanon County. While this might seem to be a trivial matter, it must be remembered that the book's author claimed to have been a local resident and might be expected to have been better informed regarding the basics of local geography. Hermit includes some of the earliest instances of the 'aliases' Amos and Harriot, and might be the source of those names. The book often appears more concerned with providing moral instruction than with presenting a factual account; The Life of Amos Wilson contains the passage, ``You see by the foregoing pages the gradation of evils dependent on a departure from...dignified modesty,'' and admonishes readers to ``(t)urn your attention to those houses of debauchery where Vice reigns triumphant, and on whom poor mourning Virtue sheds a tear of pity.'' As such, its author may have changed the names of his lead characters in light of their questionable relationship with the historical figures of William and Elizabeth.

In 2004, the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress announced the transfer of the collection to the Library.

1228	Boag was born at Highgate in the parish of Beith, Ayrshire, on 7 January 1775.

He acted for many years as an evangelist, and not infrequently in the open air or by the wayside. He had small charges in the Isle of Man and Helensburgh. Ultimately he accepted the appointment of pastor over a very small independent congregation in the village of Blackburn, Linlithgowshire, from which, it is believed, he never received more than 25l. to 30l. a year. He also kept a day-school on his own account. It was in this humble position that Boag compiled his magnum opus. His aim was to combine etymology, pronunciation, and explanation of scientific terms and others used in art and literature. He wished also to incorporate (1) new words since Johnson, and (2) modifications and other changes of meanings. He commenced this arduous undertaking after he had entered his seventieth year. Within three years his manuscript was ready for the press. It was printed and published by the Edinburgh Printing and Publishing Company. Unfortunately this company speedily became bankrupt. About 1847 Messrs. Fullarton & Co. became proprietors of the ''Imperial Lexicon,`` and issued it in parts or numbers, constituting two massive volumes. The work had an enormous sale and held its own until the publication of Ogilvie's Dictionary, which was largely based upon it. Prefixed was a ''Popular Grammar of the English Language,`` by Mr. R. Whyte. Besides his ''Imperial Lexicon,`` Boag was the author of a number of pamphlets on questions of the day, and was a frequent contributor to contemporary religious periodicals.

One account given of his history states that his proper name was Philippe, and that he served as a French officer in the campaign in Flanders, but afterwards devoted himself to the pursuit of art. He was endowed with extraordinary capacity; and had his application been but equal to his genius, few would have surpassed him in the branch of art to which his natural disposition directed him.

Unfortunately, from his idle and dissolute course of life, he seldom exercised his abilities until compelled by necessity. The drawings, in chalk and with the pen, which he has left make us deeply regret that the irregularity of his life has limited these admirable productions to a much smaller number than his uncommon facility would otherwise have secured to us. Chatelain was much employed by Boydell, especially in engraving with Vivares the series of landscapes after Claude, Rembrandt, Guaspre, and others. Vivares being more appreciated by the public, his name was often placed on plates engraved by Chatelain alone, as in the case of a fine landscape after Pietro da Cortona, and another named 'The Storm,' in which Poussin has introduced the story of Pyramus and Thisbe. He engraved, also for Boydell, eleven views in London and in Italy. He died in London in 1771. The following list comprises his most important works:

Her younger brother Manfred Oettl Reyes, also an alpine skier, was selected for the team as well. She is scheduled to compete in both the slalom and giant slalom competitions there, although she was not expected to be in serious competition for a medal. Her participation on behalf of Peru was questioned by some, as she was not only born in Germany but lives there and is of Peruvian descent on only one side of her family. She and her brother were last minute additions to the Olympic roster. They both met the minimum time qualifications for participation, but that participation was questioned as neither had taken part in a World Championship prior to the Olympics. In response to this criticism, the Peruvian Olympic Committee explained that they were in the process of receiving their Peruvian passports when the last World Championships took place, and so could not yet compete on behalf of Peru. The controversy also prompted some commenters to question why the Peruvian government has not done more to identify and develop athletes within the country. However, the practice of smaller countries sending athletes who are technically citizens of those countries but who reside elsewhere to participate in international competitions is not uncommon. Despite the controversy, the pair asked Peruvians to embrace them and their participation on behalf of Peru at the Olympics.

In a letter to the Lords of Trade from Teneriffe, dated the 15th of December 1764, Glas said he believed the reason for his detention was the jealousy of the Spaniards at the settlement at Port Hillsborough because in a time of war the English might ruin their fishery and effectually stop the whole commerce of the Canary Islands.

His grandfather, Thomas Littleton Sullivan, the son of an Irish barrister, emigrated from Charleville, County Cork, Ireland, in 1791, to Augusta County, Va. Algernon S. Sullivan was educated at Hanover College, Hanover, Ind., and at Miami University, Oxford, O., where he was graduated in 1845. While a law student, about the age of twenty, he made a tour of Indiana, speaking with marked success in advocacy of taxation for the maintenance of public schools. After studying law in his father's office, he was admitted to the bar in 1848, and for eight years practiced in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1857 he moved to New York city, and soon took a prominent position as a lawyer and public spirited citizen. He was retained to defend the officers and crew of the Confederate schooner Savannah, the first vessel to be captured during the civil war, who were on trial for their lives on the charge of piracy. Owing to some inimical reports about him, he was arrested and imprisoned, but soon released. After the trial began, public feeling ran so high that his life was threatened if he should appear in their defense. He nevertheless did so, telling his friends that, having been appealed to as a lawyer, he could consider no other course, and the ultimate result of the trial was that the men were exchanged as prisoners of war. From 1870-73 Mr. Sullivan was assistant district attorney for New York city, and upon leaving that office he formed a partnership with Hermann Kobbe and Ludlow Fowler. In 1875 he was appointed public administrator, during which he instituted many reforms, reducing the charges upon estates administered, and, in spite of pressure, retaining in his service efficient assistants of a political party different from his own. In 1878 the firm of Sullivan, Kobbe & Fowler was dissolved and he formed a partnership with William Nelson Cromwell, under the name of Sullivan & Cromwell, which firm name is still retained by the successors to his business. Mr. Sullivan was recognized as one of the strongest, readiest and most successful jury lawyers in New York, and he was admired and revered by both bench and bar. His kindness, candor and fairness, even during the heat of a trial, were always the subject of remark. Judge Bookstaver, of New York, in speaking of him, said: ``He was always welcomed by the court in any case in which he appeared, because it was felt that his learning, ability and absolute truthfulness would assist the court in the trial of any question of law and fact with which it had to deal.'' He was noted for seeking opportunities for helping and encouraging younger lawyers. His interests were very broad, and his sympathy both deep and active. No individual ever appealed to him without receiving what was needed, either money, service, guidance or encouragement. There were few movements for public welfare, alleviation of suffering or the upholding of high ideals that did not receive his efficient aid. He was a brilliant and convincing orator, and was often chosen to speak at public gatherings because of his prominence and eloquence. One of his most famous orations was at the laying of the cornerstone of the Produce Exchange, made at an hour's notice. In all of his work there was great readiness, versatility and ease. On the platform he was peculiarly attractive and effective. He was tall, handsome in face and form, graceful in movement, impressive and most winning in manner and presence. His voice was full, penetrating, musical and sympathetic. His style was direct, simple and vividly realistic. He was a Whig in politics until 1856, when he became a Democrat, in which party he remained until his death. He was active in party work, but with great independence.

Even today, he is held in high esteem by his students, some of whom are luminaries of the Indian cinema. Arun Khopkar, filmmaker and student of Bahadur, was quoted as saying, '''...from day one, he became the guiding light in my life. Like a music teacher who explains the intricacies of taal and laya to his students, he would unveil countless aspects of films for us. Unlike many teachers who overshadow their students, he had the knack to bring the best out of his students. In fact, he was the one who started the concept of film diary amongst FTII students. I have this habit of calling the old, good and late faculty of the institute, the ghost faculty. Now, he belongs to that and sitting up there, he will continue to guide his students``.

Igor is married to Elena Tulipanov, also a painter, since 1977. Igor Tiulpanov employs Surrealist imagery in his meticulous illusionistic paintings, incorporating stylistic elements from Leonardo da Vinci, Hieronymus Bosch, and Jan van Eyck. These paintings are pictorial retracings of the artist's subconscious and show characteristics of what Freud called ``dream work,'' including the existence of contrary elements side by side, the condensation of two or more objects or images, and the use of objects that have symbolic value. Igor Tulipanov is influenced by and sometimes incorporates whole scenes from Hieronymus Bosch in his paintings. The symbols Tulipanov uses, various statues of pagan gods, spectacles, books, tears, eggs, mirrors pass from painting to painting but the meaning of each symbol changes depending on the painting. What remains always is the incredible detail, the logic in his compositions, the precision of his tiny brush strokes, his infatuation with the world and its mysteries. Sometimes it takes a year to finish a painting, sometimes even longer. Igor Tulipanov's purpose is to create a world harmonious and complicated in its simplicity, a world that exists in his imagination. His paintings are exhibited in private collections and museums of the U.S.A., Russia, Japan, Argentina, and other countries.

Allan Pinkerton himself claimed that Kate Warne came into his agency and demanded to become a detective. According to Pinkerton's records, he ``was surprised to learn Kate was not looking for clerical work, but was actually answering an advertisement for detectives he had placed in a Chicago newspaper. At the time, such a concept was almost unheard of. Pinkerton said '' It is not the custom to employ women detectives! `` Kate argued her point of view eloquently - pointing out that women could be ''most useful in worming out secrets in many places which would be impossible for a male detective. `` A Woman would be able to befriend the wives and girlfriends of suspected criminals and gain their confidence. Men become braggarts when they are around women who encourage them to boast. Kate also noted, Women have an eye for detail and are excellent observers.'' http://www.pinkertons.com/webster.htm

3044	His twelve novels thus far are somewhat thematically linked. The first the novels, written in the 1970s, were basically coming of age or bildungsroman novels. The next three, his third, fourth and fifth books (``The Good Son, ''The Congressman's Daughter`` and ''Tornado Alley``) are often thought of as his Passion Trilogy, sharing similar structures (each novel is broken up into different ''books``; each novel is narrated in the first person by a variety of characters, male and female). And the books share similar geography, with stories that either take place largely in the East (as it does in ''The Congressman's Daughter``), or which begin on the East coast and gradually move West. ''The Good Son`` starts out in the East (Ohio), New York and in New England (Vermont, etc.), where Nova lived for over three decades, and its denouement takes place in both the West (Washington) and East, New York. ''Tornado Alley``, The last book in the Passion Trilogy moves the action from the East coast (Pennsylvania) across country to the West coast, in California, where the majority of Nova's story about passion, adultery and unrequited love plays out. In each book, a serious conflict arises between parent and child, or man and wife (or both), usually due to one or both of them being in love (complicated triangles were part of Nova's well-written bag of tricks during this era of his career). This Passion Trilogy may well prove to be Nova's personal masterpiece. In its unerring ability to capture Americans of all classes (lower, middle and upper) and the struggles for power that take place everyday (between father and son, father and daughter, husband and wife, etc.), and its uncanny ability to capture the voices of characters feminine and masculine, the three novels and writing therein are reminiscent of the best work of Booth Tarkington. A book critic for the Seattle Times was moved to write, ''I see them as the all-American prose equivalent to Beethoven's Symphonies Nos. 3, 5 and 7. ...there's a genuinely classical grandeur to Nova's tales of erotic derailment and titanic family conflict. `` Nova's next three novels, his seventh, eighth and ninth books (''Trombone``, ''The Book of Dreams``, and ''The Universal Donor``), are linked geographically, with all of the action taking place on the West coast, largely in California, where Nova was born and raised. As a child, he played with the daughter of Jane Mansfield and as a teenager, raced against Steve McQueen. His Hollywood childhood was put to good use in his California trilogy of novels that taken on relationships the various people (lovers, fathers, friends and others) wrapped up in movie-making and con games, with the lines between both often being blurred. In his three most recent novels (''Wetware``, ''Cruisers``, and ''The Informer``), Nova has moved into the genre of crime and mystery fiction, taking cues and borrowing tropes from writers like William Gibson (''Wetware``), James M. Cain (''Cruisers``) and Graham Greene (''The Informer``).

3786	Born in Talence, south-west France near Bordeaux region, Gérard Rancinan started his career at the Sygma press agency of which he became one of the leading lights. During his time with the agency he travelled the globe, bearing first hand witness to events of historical importance. Covering natural catastrophes, civil and ethnic wars, and urban riots, he came face to face with the complexity of the human condition and the random events by which it is fashioned. His thirst for freedom and an imperious need for self-expression rapidly convinced him to go freelance. Reserving himself the right to focus on the world's most important issues, he delivers startling images filtered through an ever-evolving aesthetic prism. Constantly breaking down barriers, he is, by turn, a photographer working on communication campaigns, and an investigator deconstructing the great sagas of contemporary life for the international portrait press for which his photographs of athletes, artists, ecclesiastics and politicians have become iconic. His images have earned him a number of prizes, including four prestigious World Press Awards. Following his domain of predilection, in a ``journey to the heart of man'' he becomes the wakeful observer of his contemporaries. This marginal perspective involves real mises en scène, veritable simulacra of the world in which we live. Internationally renowned, Gérard Rancinan's work is exhibited in the world's most prestigious galleries and museums and features in the most important contemporary art collections. During a recent Etude Million auction at Drouot (2008), Gérard Rancinan became one of the highest ranked photographers in France. Gérard Rancinan is a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres.

He was also the Leader of Hereroland from 1968-1970. In 1920, Hosea Kutako was officially appointed as leader of the Herero by Frederik Maharero. Frederik had been empowered to transfer power by his father, Herero chief Samuel Maharero, who had been exiled after the Herero War and was since banned from entering the country by the South African Mandatory Administration. Hosea Kutako took over his role as a commitment to preserve the memory of the glorious times of the Herero before and during the German colonisation as well as of the atrocities in the battle of Waterberg. Already in 1920, he founded the Green Flags, an association to keep up tradition, and went on by founding the Red Flags in 1923, after Samuel Maharero's death. Kutako prompted and organised the transfer of Samuel Maharero's body and its funeral on Okahandja next to the grave of Jonker Afrikaner. Kutako also founded the Truppenspieler association. It was meant to get military importance which was opposed both by the South African authorities and by Sam Nujoma, the co-founder of the South West African People's Organisation SWAPO. So, the Truppenspieler had to content themselves with an accompanying role at Herero Day. Along with Nujoma, Hosea Kutako founded the South West African National Union (SWANU) in 1959, an organisation that was to merge into SWAPO a year later. It later re-emerged as a separate political entity. Despite his age, Hosea Kutako particularly engaged for the independence of future Namibia. Windhoek's international airport, the country's primary international airport, is named after him. In July 2010, Kutako's former home in the Omaheke Region was nominated by the Omaheke Regional Council to become a national heritage site.

It was as a member of the convention that Rice pleaded for a gradual emancipation initiative, giving an address entitled, Slavery Inconsistent with Justice and Good Policy. Ultimately, Rice saw the institution of slavery as not only unconstitutional, but as that which violated the most basic tenets of a natural, moral law. He believed, moreover, that it was especially the responsibility of the church to lead the cause for emancipation, expressing in 1799 in a letter to a friend that he wanted Christians to adopt ``a rational plan for the gradual abolition of slavery; and do it under the influence of religion and conscience, without any regard for law'' (Letter to James Blythe, 1799). In 1792, Rice served as an elected delegate to the Danville convention of 1792 where he pushed for the insertion of a clause in the state's first constitution that would have ended slavery. Rice, ultimately unsuccessful in his efforts towards abolition, served for much of the rest of his life in the Kentucky Abolition Society.

He published Boat Life in Egypt and Nubia and Tent Life in the Holy Land based on his experiences there, which include his accounts of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Dead Sea, and the port of Jaffa, among others. In The Innocents Abroad, Mark Twain parodies Tent Life in the Holy Land as Grime's Nomadic Life in Palestine, taking aim at Prime's overly sentimental prose and his violent encounters with the local inhabitants. Twain makes the contemporary popularity of Tent Life evident in his parody: ``Some of us will be shot before we finish this pilgrimage. The pilgrims read ''Nomadic Life`` and keep themselves in a constant state of Quixotic heroism.`` Twain speculates that if a homicide did occur, Grimes should be prosecuted as an ''accessory before the fact.`` Prime continued practicing law until 1861, when he became part owner and editor-in-chief of the New York Journal of Commerce. In 1869 he gave up his editorial work and revisited Egypt and the Holy Land.

5998	Sacrobosco is also called John of Holywood, by reverse etymology from the Latin sacro bosco. A traditional belief, that he was born in Halifax, is due to the 16th century author, John Leland, and was discredited by William Camden: Halifax means 'holy hair', not 'holy wood'. Sacrobosco has been identified, by Thomas Dempster, with an Augustinian canon from Holywood Abbey, Nithsdale (in fact a Premonstratensian house); which would be a reason for presuming him a Scot. He is also claimed by Holywood, County Down, this being based on a suggestion of Richard Stanihurst. However, Pederson attributes this assertion to Holywood being known to Stanihurst. Pedersons book mentioned that in 1639 James Ware assumed that the birthplace of Sacrobosco was near Dublin. Stanihurst and even Pederson were probably unaware that the seat of the Sacrobosco/Hollywood family in Ireland was in Artane, a suburb of Dublin (``The History of the County of Dublin'' by John D'Alton published in 1838). Local historical records in Ireland seem to indicate that Sacrobosco was a member of the Artane Hollywoods and was born in Artane Castle. A similar claim is made for Holywood, County Wicklow, though there is no known historical document which supports this.

Although he has painted in a variety of styles, from abstract to photo-realism, Henrik Hagtvedt is most famous for a thickly textured and highly expressive style which gained him a great deal of critical acclaim and media attention early in his career. It was presumably this style that earned him the nickname ``The Northern Light,'' first given to him in Italy. However, little time elapsed before Hagtvedt began declining exhibitions and distancing himself from the contemporary art scene, thus virtually disappearing from both the public eye and from mainstream art institutions, almost as suddenly as he had appeared upon the scene some years earlier.

According to Turvey, the allegation of Henry VIII's fatherhood originated with Sir Robert Naunton (1563--1635). Naunton never knew Sir John, and used second-hand accounts of his person and character, along with a series of historically inaccurate events to reach his conclusion on John's paternity. For example, John was Mary Berkeley's third child, not her first, and history does not record her and the king being in the same location during this period. Naunton even claimed that Sir Owen Hopton, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, overheard Sir John say, 'Will the Queen suffer her brother to be offered up a sacrifice to the envy of his frisking adversaries? ' thus suggesting that Perrot himself fueled the rumours of his paternity. However, Hopton had been removed from the Tower 18 months prior to Perrot's imprisonment, so he could not have overheard Perrot make the claim there.

He spent time performing both the violin and the cornet for a circus band in Prague. He also performed as an aerialist acrobat with the Rentz Circus in Germany, but an accident in 1886 ended this line of work. His father was a sculptor, and Bohumir also studied this art.

This group was based at Madison Square Garden, at $800 per-month and became its assistant conductor in 1903.

His solos would result in requests for multiple encores. Studying bandleaders Creatore and Vessela, he adopted a wild 'lionesque' hairstyle that became his trademark. He became acquainted with Joseph Jiran, who owned a Czechoslovakian music store in Chicago. With Jiran's encouragement, he formed his own band in 1906 styled as Kryl's Bohemian Band by 1910 with the Cimera brothers. This group worked for Columbia, Victor, and Zonophone, recording works by such composers as Smetana, Dvorak, and Safranek.

He later formed a ``Women's Symphony Orchestra'' that featured daughter Josephine on violin and daughter Marie on piano. He also formed and conducted the ''Kryl Symphony Orchestra``, which featured soloists such as Florian ZaBach and vocalist Mary McCormic. His public musical career ended in the late 1940s, when he had difficulties with the American Federation of Musicians, because although his musicians were well taken care of, he did not pay scale. His last groups played popular dance music as well as ''heavier classics``. Before his musical retirement, he had traveled more than one million miles and soloed more than 12,000 times. His touring included many small towns such as Albany, Oregon and Bend, Oregon, where his orchestra was the first appearance by any symphony orchestra there. Aside from the United States, he toured Canada, Cuba, and Mexico with his bands and orchestras and America and Europe with his daughters. He later formed booking agency and a music bureau.

His chief patron was Lucullus, whose gentile name he assumed. In 93 BC he visited Sicily with his patron, on which occasion he received the citizenship of Lucanian Heraclea, one of the federate towns, and indirectly, by the provisions of the Lex Plautia Papiria, that of Rome. In 62 BC he was accused by a certain Gratius of having assumed the citizenship illegally; and Cicero successfully defended him in his speech Pro Archia. This speech, which furnishes nearly all the information concerning Archias, states that he had celebrated the deeds of Gaius Marius and Lucullus in the Cimbrian and Mithridatic Wars, and that he was engaged upon a poem of which the events of Cicero's consulship formed the subject. The Greek Anthology contains thirty-five epigrams under the name of Archias, but it is doubtful how many of these (if any) are his work.

6997	Barrie Karp (b. 1945 in Laredo, Texas) is a New York City philosophy professor and visual artist. Karp's work, as scholar and educator is at the intersection between (and arguably goes well beyond) several distinct disciplines and practices: between feminist and anti-racist critique, between psychoanalysis and political activism, and between literature, art, visual culture, and new media studies. Karp is interested in Continental philosophy, for instance the work of Luce Irigaray, and in the work of American feminists such as bell hooks, Judith Butler, Drucilla Cornell, Patricia J. Williams, Hazel Carby, Angela Davis, Sara Ruddick and Ann duCille. Through her pedagogy and scholarly activity, Karp has helped define feminism as a movement that can work across disciplinary boundaries and be informed by various traditions of scholarship. Karp has also worked to separate feminism from the so-called white privilege with which its critics sometimes associated it. Paintings of Karp's were featured in the November/December 2008 issue of Tikkun magazine and by the Tikkun editor's August 2009 online blog.

Daly's translation was the first Sanguineti book to be rendered into English. According to the publishers, Dedalus Press/Dufour Editions, Daly accepted the difficult task of translating Libretto ``because he finds Sanguineti's poetry so lifeaffirming, and because he believes that even the poorest translation may lead people to read more of him.'' His latest collection of poems is Clinging to the Myth (2007) in which he refelects on grief and personal bereavement and uses the voices of 18th century Gaelic poetry to respond to the challenges of a post-Christian Ireland. As well as broadcasting on RTÉ radio, some of Daly's works have been translated into Italian for broadcast on Italian radio.

Eighteen productions in other countries have made Scherenschnitt a singular international hit: following Agatha Christie`s Mouse Trap, Paul Pörtner`s interactive play is the longest-running play around the world.
